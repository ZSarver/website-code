:summary: Resumes like you've never seen them before.

For the past couple of months I've been not so quietly working on a brand new
format in which to distribute my resume. For all those employers who are tired
of looking at boring old resumes and CVs, there's now a much more exciting way
to shoot down job applications. Literally!

That's right, this new resume format is video games. Specifically, it's inspired
by Taito's 1978 classic `Space Invaders
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders>`_.

You can download my `resume in invaders format
<{filename}/zips/resumeinvaders.zip>`_. It should run on Windows 7 and
up. Eventually I will provide binaries for other systems, but until then...

You can also see the `source code on my
GitHub account <https://github.com/ZSarver/CVInvaders>`_, complete with
tongue-in-cheek readme.
