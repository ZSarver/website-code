:summary: Getting to know me; getting to know all about me.

My name is Zachary Sarver, and I am a PhD candidate in mathematics at Auburn
University. You most likely followed one of the links in my CV, so you knew that
already. I'll get back to the serious stuff shortly, but here are a few things
about me that you **won't** learn from reading my curriculum vitae:

* Here's what I look like:

* I'm a first generation American. After the war, my grandparents emigrated
  from Hungary to West Germany, where my mother was born. In the 1960s, they
  immigrated to Cleavland, OH and became naturalized citizens. How I wound up in
  the deep south is a story for another time.
* I'm an avid reader, and I mostly read science fiction and fantasy. A shoutout
  to my favorite author `Neal Stephenson <http://www.nealstephenson.com/>`_.
* I enjoy video games of all kinds, but mostly `platformers
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_Super_Star>`_ and `arcade-style games
  <http://www.pastagames.com/pix-the-cat/>`_. I love to sink my teeth into a
  good `strategy game <http://www.nisamerica.com/games/pb/>`_ or `RPG
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skies_of_Arcadia>`_ when I'm not writing my
  dissertation.
* I collect Sega hardware and games.
* Chess is fun when you play casually, and Go is interesting, but what I'm
  really fascinated with is `Arimaa <http://arimaa.com/arimaa/>`_, a game
  designed to be easy for humans to pick up and play but extremely difficult for
  computers to master.
* Constructed languages and writing systems fascinate me. I've designed two
  writing systems, and I know just a bit of `Lojban
  <https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban>`_. coi rodo .i la lojban. cinri mi.
* I love music of all styles and genres (except country.) I especially enjoy
  `progressive rock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta>`_, my
  favorite symphony is `Mahler's 2nd
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdc5n562zZg>`_, and a big shoutout to
  `OverClocked Remix <http://ocremix.org/>`_ for the literally hundreds of hours
  of free music to write my dissertation to.

And now back to the stuff that you could glean from my CV. My research interests
are primarily in:

* linear algebra
* matrix analysis
* Lie theory

I'm also quite curious about:

* multilinear algebra
* category theory
* symmetric and inverse limit spaces
* computability
* programming language design

On the topic of programming language design, I'm proficient in a few programming
languages:

* C
* C++
* Python
* Haskell

And I have at least a little experience in quite a few more:

* Java
* Ruby
* Go
* Rust
* MOS 6502 assembly (on the Atari 2600 and Apple //e)
* Zilog Z80 assembly (on the Sega SG-1000 and Sega Master System)

In my spare time (I know, right? Who has that?) I'm active in the `Auburn puzzle
scene <http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/Home>`_ as a participant, puzzle
designer, and event organizer.
