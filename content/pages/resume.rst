Resume
##############

:tags: informative
:slug: resume
:authors: Zachary Sarver
:summary: The short, short CV.

You can find an up-to-date version of my resume hosted on Github, right `here
<https://github.com/ZSarver/cv/blob/master/resume/resume.pdf>`_.

Better yet, you can `play my resume as an arcade-style game
<{filename}/zips/resumeinvaders.zip>`_. It should run on Windows 7 and
up. Binaries for other systems incoming, but until then you can get the `source
code <https://github.com/ZSarver/CVInvaders>`_, complete with tongue-in-cheek
readme.
