I've always had a list of dreams I want to achieve, works of unparalleled art
and beauty that I want to create, and things I want to accomplish before I bite
it. Sometimes these goals are aligned with my career goals, sometimes they are
orthogonal. I've decided to make this list public, as a sort of accountability
on my part. I will edit this list as I complete goals or add to it. Without
further ado:
